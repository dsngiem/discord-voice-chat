# Discord Video Chat

The goal of this project is to utilize Discord to have a video chat room where both messages and cams can be seen side-by-side. It is built on Angular so it can be deploy for free on Google's Firebase solution. Since Discord is the backend, the main application should remain lightweight as to not hit the monthly data caps.

Additionally, a Chrome extension is required to allow Discord to be displayed in an iframe. The Chrome extension is also utilized to inject javascript and CSS to automate and better design Discord for the format desired.

## Structure
The project is separated into two packages: the application and the extension.
